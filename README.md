### Introduction

A simple python code for reading Oklahoma Mesonet data (http://mesonet.org) into python and plotting standard meteogram plots. The code accounts for missing data (-999,-998) and works with using a dictionary for assigning colors and plots. 

I used this as a learning opportunity to learn more about using python.
### To Do

* read data directly from the mesonet archive
* option for plotting temperatures in F or C
* clean-up old methods
